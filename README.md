# Matplotlib Challenge

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

## Resources

The data used can be located within the "/data" folder

The main script used to run the analysis can be found under "Matplotlib.ipynb"

## Instructions

Run the provided package dependency and data imports, and then merge the mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame.

Display the number of unique mice IDs in the data, and then check for any mouse ID with duplicate time points. Display the data associated with that mouse ID, and then create a new DataFrame where this data is removed. Use this cleaned DataFrame for the remaining steps.

Display the updated number of unique mice IDs.

Create a DataFrame of summary statistics. Remember, there is more than one method to produce the results you're after, so the method you use is less important than the result.

Generate two bar charts. Both charts should be identical and show the total number of time points for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the study.

Generate two pie charts. Both charts should be identical and show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Then, calculate the quartiles and IQR, and determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

Using Matplotlib, generate a box plot that shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group. Highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.

Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin, and generate a line plot of tumor volume versus time point for that mouse.

Generate a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.

Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
